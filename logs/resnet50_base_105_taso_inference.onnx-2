Using security parameter 40
Trying to run 64-bit computation
Client-side handshake with P1 failed. Make sure both sides  have the necessary certificate (Player-Data/P2.pem in the default configuration on their side and Player-Data/P1.pem on ours), and run `c_rehash <directory>` on its location.
The certificates should be the same on every host. Also make sure that it's still valid. Certificates generated with `Scripts/setup-ssl.sh` expire after a month.
